## Options for purchasing

* [PCBWay link](https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/RCMHardwareByte_v2_3_e23eec63.html) (PCBWay will give me a commission without increasing the price for you). (approximately $90 for 2 boards and manufacturing took a month).
* send the gerbers, bill of materials, and ComponentPlacement files to a PCB manufacturer of your choice (details you may be asked for: min hole 0.25mm, min track/spacing 5/5mil, thickness 1.0mm, 1 oz Cu outer 1.5 oz Cu inner)

## Components
Solder by hand to complete the assembly of your boards.
